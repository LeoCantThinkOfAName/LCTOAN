### About LCTOAN.

LCTOAN., the short form of "Leo cant't think of a name". Apparently I cannot think of a better name for myself...

Ok, I know that doesn't express too much about me. So, this is the real deal.

I'm a self-taught web developer, who had over four years experience in the business. And am currently the front-end leader in the company with two relatively junior level developers.

Since our company working closely with travel related businesses, that makes me have the privilege to leave my fingerprints on the internet by building websites for some high-profile hotel groups etc.

As a team leader (kind of), I also routinely do some pair-programming session, internal training and stuff... It's kinda stressful actually, because I really don't wanna mess it up. (lol)

Anyway, it's pretty much of it. Hope you do like my works ( especially this website, because I did everything myself ). If you haven't checkout my works, please do! If you have something want to say, there's link above. Feel free to contact me anytime!

Leo Lin.
